# Olympic-History

Let's look at various vizualizations of Olympic Performance and History

Where have the games been held?  The first map shows us where, with locations colored and sized according to the number of countries participating.  Click on one of the circles to show information about which year the games were held there and how many participants there were.
For a bit more information, enter a "from year" in the selection field and  we'll run the numbers, to a table on the right.
We present a barchart of the top medal winners for any selected year.
Finally, information about the profits and losses of games starting in 1976 are presented in a variety of formats.
